## Hey Now

I have been running a blog since before there was a WordPress :)  

I made a living for a long time as a web developer, and specifically with WordPress for a decade.  I became more and more disillusioned with WordPress as it got more and more bloated.

Ever since I have been working with different front-ends and static site generators to come up with a modern blog solution.  

I have tried Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby for static sites.  I choose Vue as my preferred front-end solution for development and have settled on [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) for a blog soultion for now.  I like the simplicity of it, and the fact that it is Vue based.  I am a big fan of [Vue](https://tr1pwyr.com/page/vue).
