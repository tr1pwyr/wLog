The 2024 presidential election is still a long way off, but that hasn’t stopped pundits from speculating about who will be the Republican nominee. One name that has been getting a lot of attention lately is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Let’s take a look at why Ron DeSantis might be the 2024 GOP Nominee.

#### The Florida Governor is now the GOP front runner over Donald Trump

Ron DeSantis is now[ the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for President](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3653326-desantis-tops-trump-by-8-points-among-florida-republicans-in-new-poll/), overtaking [Donald Trump](https://headlin3s.com/tags/Trump) in the polls. This is a significant shift in the race, as DeSantis was previously considered to be a long shot.  
  
There are several reasons why DeSantis is now the front runner. First, he has strong support from [Florida](https://headlin3s.com/dateline/Florida), which is a key state in the primaries. Second, he has won the endorsement of several high-profile Republicans, including Mitt Romney. third, he has been somewhat critical of Trump’s policies and has positioned himself as a more traditional conservative.  
  
DeSantis still faces some challenges, however. He is relatively unknown on the national stage, and he will need to raise a lot of money to compete with Trump in the primaries. Nonetheless, he is now in [a strong position to win the Republican nomination](https://trendingpoliticsnews.com/boom-desantis-just-got-some-huge-2024-news-from-a-florida-poll-wiley/) for President.

Ron DeSantis Tops Polls of Republican Hopefuls
----------------------------------------------

Ron DeSantis, the current Governor of Florida, is at the top of the polls when it comes to potential Republican nominees for President in 2020. DeSantis has consistently polled higher than any other Republican hopefuls, including former Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Marco Rubio.

DeSantis has been a strong supporter of President Trump, and has been dubbed “Trump’s mini-me” by some. He has aligned himself closely with the President on issues like immigration and tax reform. This has endeared him to Trump’s base of supporters, who are likely to be a significant force in the Republican primary process.  
  
DeSantis’s high poll numbers show that he is a serious contender for the Republican nomination. It remains to be seen whether he will be able to maintain his lead as more candidates enter the race.

#### Ron DeSantis Takes on Woke CRT


Ron DeSantis has been a vocal critic of so-called “woke Critical Race Theory” (CRT). He has accused the Biden administration of trying to “indoctrinate” Americans with CRT. In a recent speech, DeSantis said that CRT is “divisive” and “toxic.” He also accused the [Biden administration](https://wlog.app/posts/biden-administration-incompetent-or-vindictive.html) of promoting CRT in schools and the military.  
  
DeSantis has vowed to ban CRT in Florida schools if he is elected governor. He has also said that he will cut funding to any school that teaches CRT.  
  
DeSantis’ stance on CRT is likely to appeal to GOP voters who are opposed to the teaching of this controversial theory. It could also help him gain support from Trump voters who see DeSantis as a strong ally of the former president.
