The Cryptocurrency boom has triggered a new wave of activity that began with the creation of the world’s first digital currency, Bitcoin. Most people know Bitcoin, but a little-known fact is that there are literally thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies.

Before we look at the alternatives to Bitcoin, let us take a step back and examine briefly what the terms “cryptocurrency” and “legacy coin” mean. A cryptocurrency, broadly speaking, is a currency that takes the form of a coin or token and exists on a distributed or decentralized ledger. Decentralized or peer-to-peer distribution is what enables crypto currency to exist without a central bank or central authority.

### Alt Coins

Converting bitcoin [cryptocurrency](https://wlog.app/posts/crypto-volatility.html) into alt-coins is as easy as swapping bitcoin for ethereum, ripple, or any of a myriad of other alternative crypto currencies.

There is no doubt that [Bitcoin](https://headlin3s.com/tag/bitcoin) has been on an upward trend for several years, but we cannot predict its long-term impact on the global economy. There is no way of knowing if Bitcoin will continue to lead the cryptocurrency market much less shape humanity as early forms of money have done in the past.

The next big digital token could be released tomorrow, but digital currencies have been pushed by companies like Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash, Ethereum Classic and others. This is a single platform that combines the ability to send airwaves to Coinbase without Bitcoin deposit fees in a way that is open to all. It is a marketplace system that has been fragmented, but it is the first of its kind in the digital currency space.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are not as anonymous as you might think, individuals and organizations that use cryptocurrencies still leave a digital footprint. Soon the new wave of encrypted digital money will arrive, the first wave in the space of digital currency.

#### Cryptocurrencies 

Cryptocurrencies are the complicated cryptography that allows digital money to be exchanged between two or more digital currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. So it comes down to an exchange, to the transfer of coins from one to the other via a software wallet, to the printing of the private key and the public address, to the creation of a coin by a special service or to the creation and production of another coin by special services.

All Bitcoin transactions are documented in a digital register called Blockchain, where each user’s cryptocurrency pocket is represented by a unique set of random numbers and letters.

As such, CoinMarketCap has chosen to exclude XRP, Ethereum and Dollar, so you can set up and cross buy / sell orders for E-Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin and Bitcoin.

Bulls can increase their momentum, Coinbase and OKCoin have joined the list of other cryptocurrency exchanges that have suspended trading on the platform. That’s more than a dollar higher than any other exchange rate, according to the Korean Stock Exchange. It hasn’t been confirmed, but it’s probably more of a rumor than anything else, at least for now.

Ardent cryptofanatics have seized on the fact that even central banks need a blockchain cryptocurrency to get into the digital currency game. In countries where Bitcoin is illegal as a cryptocurrency, they are in the midst of a “digital chain letter” that promises a return if you buy now and find more and more buyers joining the chain.
