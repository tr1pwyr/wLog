The coming stock market crash is inevitable. It’s not a matter of if, but when. The writing is on the wall, and has been for some time. My only question is how bad it will be.

### The Stock Market Bubble

The stock market is in a bubble. This has been evident for years, but has only recently begun to be acknowledged by the mainstream financial media. Prices have been artificially inflated by years of quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve, and are now being propped up by corporate share buybacks. This can’t last forever.

There are warning signs everywhere you look. Valuations are at unsustainable levels, [debt](https://wlog.app/posts/debt-ceiling.html) levels are skyrocketing, and economic growth is slowing down both domestically and globally. All of these factors point to a major market correction in the near future.

The coming stock market crash Investors need to be prepared for the coming crash. Those who are heavily invested in stocks should consider selling some of their position ahead of time. And everyone should have a plan for what to do with their money when the market starts to tank.

This could be the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. So don’t take it lightly; make sure you’re prepared before it happens.

#### The Great Depression Stock Market Crash

The stock market crash was a financial disaster that happened on October 29, 1929. Also known as Black Tuesday, the stock market crash was caused by a combination of factors, including the overvaluation of stocks, the lack of regulation of [business](https://headlin3s.com/cat/business) and the stock market, and the weak economy.

The crash led to the Great Depression, which was a period of economic decline in the United States that lasted from 1929 to 1939.

There are a lot of factors that point to the coming stock market crash in the near future:

- For one, stock valuations are at an all-time high. This means that there is less room for growth, and any small dip could result in a significant drop in prices.
- Additionally, interest rates are rising, which could make borrowing more expensive and put pressure on companies that have been using debt to finance their operations.
- Finally, geopolitical tensions are mounting, and this could lead to increased uncertainty and risk-aversion among investors. All of these factors could combine to create the perfect storm for a stock market crash.

Nobody can know for sure if and when the stock market will crash. It is easy however to see signs that point to a crash being more likely than not.
