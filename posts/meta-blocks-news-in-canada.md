## Meta to Block News in Canada Over New Law

Meta, the parent company of [Facebook](https://headlin3s.com/search/facebook) and Instagram, has announced that it will begin blocking news from its platforms in Canada on February 2, 2023. This is in response to Bill C-18, the Online News Act, which would require tech giants like Meta to pay Canadian news publishers for using their content.

Meta has argued that the bill is unfair and would force it to pay for content that it does not use. The company also says that the bill would stifle innovation and could lead to higher prices for consumers.

The Canadian government has defended the bill, saying that it is necessary to ensure that news publishers are fairly compensated for their work. The government has also said that the bill would not stifle innovation, and that it would actually lead to more news content being created.

The blocking of news on Facebook and Instagram will affect millions of people [Canada](https://headlin3s.com/dateline/Canada) who use the platforms to stay informed about current events. It is unclear how long the blocking will last, or if it will be extended to other countries.

The blocking of news on Facebook and Instagram has been met with mixed reactions. Some people have praised Meta for standing up to what they see as an unfair law. Others have criticized Meta for taking away a valuable source of information for Canadians.

The Canadian government has said that it is disappointed with Meta's decision to block news. The government has also said that it is open to further discussions with Meta to try to resolve the issue.

#### What's Next?

It is unclear what will happen next in the saga of Meta and Bill C-18. The blocking of news on Facebook and Instagram could lead to further negotiations between the Canadian government and Meta. It is also possible that the Canadian government could amend the bill to address Meta's concerns.
