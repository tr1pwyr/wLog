I believe in the free enterprise system and in building upon it. I know that we can have better lives through mutual respect and understanding, not simply by fighting for our rights.

The world we live in today is one of mass consumption and greed. If we can learn to see each other as equals instead of as competitors, then we can work together to[ create a better society](https://wlog.app/posts/alternative-community.html) for all.

I want people to work together, to help each other out, and to respect each other’s differences without feeling threatened or intimidated by them.

Everyone should be allowed to do what they want with their own bodies, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to use someone else’s body against their will.

We need more than just our own personal freedoms; we need community! We need compassion for one another. I believe this compassion is best formed from within ourselves rather than from outside

### Let’s face it we all want a better world

To be able to enjoy our lives without worrying about whether or not we’re going to be able to pay the rent next month. This is all possible in a hedonistic [libertarian](https://wlog.app/posts/libertarian-party-has-failed.html) utopia.

![Hedonistic Libertarian Utopia](/uploads/2022/09/HedonisticLibertarianUtopia.webpWe want to feel safe and secure in our homes, and have enough money to live comfortably without having to work for the rest of our lives just so that we can pay for food and gas. To travel through time and space as easily as we’d like, without having to worry. Without being stuck in traffic or getting robbed on the way home from work. We would need to be able to travel through time and space as easily as we’d like.

We want everyone else in the world to have access to these things too. If they don’t, then they should provided to them.

So how do we get there? How do we create an equitable system of mutual respect and understanding between all human beings? What would that look like?

#### Hedonistic Libertarian Utopia

One of the most important things is recognizing how much power humans actually have over each other. We need to recognize to use it for good instead of evil. It’s important for us all to share resources with each other so that everyone has what they need.

If you watch the [news](https://headlin3s.com) you’ll see wars, racism, and all sorts of other issues that seem to be getting worse as time goes on. But if you think about it, most of these things were not always this way. There was a time when people lived a more peaceful existence and were more understanding of each other’s differences.

That is exactly what people look back on as their Utopian society. This was achieved by creating an environment where everyone had equal opportunities to succeed without fear or prejudice, and by founding the company on the principle that everyone should be treated with respect and dignity regardless of race or gender.
