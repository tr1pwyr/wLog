Just two weeks into his tenure as President, Donald Trump famously lamented that he’d inherited “[a disaster at the border](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-inherited-mess-press-conference-235093)” from Barack Obama. Now it seems that the Biden administration is [saying something very similar](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/why-bidens-blaming-trump-border-crisis-has-zero-credibility). It seems that they are having the same challenges securing the nation’s borders and have the same excuse.

**It was the other guys fault.**

If Biden handled the border enforcement during Obama’s eight years in office, why is his administration still struggling today?

#### What is happening at the border

The current crisis at the U.S. – [Mexico](https://headlin3s.com/dateline/Mexico) border is one of the most complex and challenging issues facing our country today. The situation is constantly evolving, making it difficult to stay up-to-date on the latest developments.

Biden Spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre Blamed the Trump Administration for the Border Crisis One thing is clear: the Trump administration’s previous policies are not making the current situation worse. Blaming [Trump](https://wlog.app/posts/ron-desantis-2024-gop-nominee.html) for the current border crisis is nothing less than passing the buck backwards. The current administration and the current administration alone is responsible for *current* humanitarian crisis.

The president has repeatedly tried to use the crisis as a bargaining chip to get his pet projects funded. Often holding the livelihoods of Dreamers and other vulnerable immigrants hostage in the process.

This is no different then what the previous administration did.

#### The message from the Biden administration is that the border is open.

However, what is different under this administration is the message that the border is open.   
  
You don’t have to take my word for it, [the migrants themselves say it](https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/3592315-bidens-open-borders-betrayal/). This has led to a desperate situation at the border. People are risking their lives to make the dangerous journey north. They come in search of safety and a better life for themselves and their families. Unfortunately, they often find themselves caught up in a system that is ill-equipped to deal with the influx of people.

The current system is bogged down by bureaucracy and an inefficient use of resources. The increase in the number of migrants coming to this country has Immigration courts backlogged. This has the effect of leaving people in limbo for months or even years. Border Patrol agents are overwhelmed and understaffed. Detention centers are overcrowded and conditions are often deplorable.

Biden may not have caused the current crisis at the border. He is most certainly, by every measure, making a bad situation even worse. His administration has released hundreds of thousands of migrants into the United States without any consequences. This caused a massive influx of illegal immigration and put a strain on our already overburdened system.

#### But Trump…

It is no secret that Donald Trump had a rocky start to his time in office. One of the biggest problems he inherited was the mess at the border. He made it one of his main priorities to clean up this mess and make the border secure. Did he accomplish this goal?

**Absolutely not.**

Critics of Trump point the finger at him and say that he is the one responsible for the current border crisis. They claim that his tough rhetoric on immigration has led to increased numbers of Central American migrants coming to the United States.

However, this is simply not true. The root cause of the current border crisis is not Trump, but the longstanding policies of previous administrations. For decades, both Republican and Democratic administrations have pursued policies that have created the conditions for mass migration from Central America.

Trump may have been a convenient face for the current border crisis, he is not responsible for it. The blame lies squarely with those in both parties who have created the conditions that have made it possible.
