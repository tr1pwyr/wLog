The best southern cities to move to

There are many great southern cities and communities to move to if you’re looking for a livable city. Here are a few of the best cities to live in the south, based on quality of life factors:

- Austin, Texas: Austin is a great option for those looking for a livable city in the south. It’s known for its lively music scene, diverse culture, and abundance of outdoor activities. It has a strong and growing economy. While Austin has seen a huge influx of new residents over the last few years housing prices are still more affordable than in many costal cities. Additionally there is no state income tax in Texas so make sure you figure that in to your calculations.

One thing to consider is that the locals take “Keep Austin Weird” seriously, so if that is a turn-off, you might want to keep scrolling. But if that is not a problem for you we think that you will find the locals generally welcoming and friendly.

Austin is a great city for families. It has a low crime rate and good schools. Check out the Texas Bike Tour as a unique way to see Austin.
