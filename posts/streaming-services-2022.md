There are a lot of best streaming services available nowadays that allow you to enjoy your favorite shows and movies from anywhere, anytime. It is an era of cord-cutting and it’s not surprising why.

Some of the best TV shows these days are all streaming exclusive. However, because of the numerous available streaming platforms, its overwhelming to choose the one that’s right for you. There are many deciding factors, such quality and variety of content, ease of use, quality of video, pricing, and more. To help you make an informed decision, here are the top streaming services with pros and cons, pricing, and more:

### **Netflix**

[Netflix](https://netflix.com) changed the way we watch TV shows and movies. With its ever-growing library and a huge selection of original programming, Netflix has become one of the most popular streaming services in UK, US, and global markets. It’s got a lot of content, both in terms of films and TV shows. While it is considered the best streaming service, Netflix doesn’t offer everything.

**Popular Shows**

- Stranger Things
- Dark
- The Witcher
- The Crown
- [Narcos](https://www.netflix.com/title/80025172)
- The OA
- The Last Kingdom

**Pros**

- Massive selection of movies and TV shows
- Netflix [True Crime](https://wlog.app/posts/true-crime-podcasts.html) originals
- Multiple plan options

**Cons**

- The starting price is costly as compared to most other streaming services
- Poor categorization
- Hard to browse

**Plans and Pricing**

Netflix offers three streaming plans.

- **Basic:** $9.99 (Standard Definition)
- **Standard:** $15.99 (Full HD)
- **Premium:** $19.99 (Full HD and 4K Ultra HD)

### **Amazon Prime Video**

[Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Video/) is another popular streaming service. It is similar to Netflix in terms of offerings. It has plenty of TV shows and a wide range of movies, including the latest releases. Amazon doesn’t have as many originals as Netflix but the handful of them it has are extremely popular and certainly worth watching.

![](/uploads/2022/03/amazonStreaming.webp)A key difference between Amazon Prime Video and Netflix is that not everything you see on Amazon is included in your package. In other words, just because a movie appears when you search for it doesn’t mean it is available on the platform for free. However, if you are not too concerned about having the latest movies, then Amazon Prime Video should suit you nicely.

**Popular Shows**

- [The Boys](https://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-Season-1/dp/B0875THX53)
- Reacher
- Mozart in the Jungle
- Good Omens
- The Wheel of Time
- The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel
- The Underground Railroad

**Cons**

**Plans and Pricing**

The standard subscription costs $8.99/month. Student membership is cheaper at $7.49/month. Amazon Prime Video is by default included with an Amazon Prime membership, which costs $139/year.

#### **Disney+**

[Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/) is relatively new to the streaming market but it has certainly made a huge impact. Not only is it affordable, but it also offers a huge array of new and classic Disney content. Apart from Disney content, there is also content from [Pixar](https://www.pixar.com/), National Geographic, Marvel universe, and the Star Wars franchise. On top of these, the original content of Disney+ has proven to be extremely popular. Overall, Disney+ is no doubt one of the best streaming services and it is suitable for a range of tastes and ages.

#### **Hulu** Streaming Services

[Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/) has a wide variety of content, including popular TV shows from NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox. The streaming service also has its own original shows, just like Netflix and Amazon. One of the best things about Hulu is that it offers several plan options. However, while the basic subscription is very cheap, it comes with a downside: ads. But if you don’t mind having a snack break from time to time then it shouldn’t be a concern. On the other hand, if you wish to watch your favorite movies and TV shows without the ads, then you will need to get a slightly pricier plan.

#### **HBO Max**

[HBO Max](https://www.hbomax.com/) is home to some of the most popular and must-see TV shows available. These include both legacy HBO programming as well as a growing number of exclusive HBO Max Originals. It is a compelling competitor to Netflix especially when you consider its pricing and the value it offers. While the interface and curation of the platform leave room for improvement, the wealth of entertainment available makes it one of the best streaming services.
