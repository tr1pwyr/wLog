Last week [Twitter labeled](https://twitter.com/davidgura/status/1643607181395197959) NPR State Affiliated Media? Is that fair? Lets rewind a little and see if the Public in National Public Radio = State Affiliated Media.

NPR was founded in 1970, as a result of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. The act authorized the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which was created to provide funding for non-commercial educational and cultural broadcasting.

#### Why Call NPR State Affiliated Media?

Unlike commercial radio stations, which rely on advertising revenue to support their operations, NPR is funded primarily through grants from foundations, donations from individual listeners, and [from the government itself](https://nypost.com/2023/04/05/twitter-gives-npr-state-affiliated-media-label/) via the CPB.

NPR is not connected to the government in any way. It is a private, non-profit organization. However, the CPB, which provides funding to NPR’s is a [government](https://wlog.app/posts/do-we-live-in-fascist-nation.html) agency.

In the early years, NPR’s programming was focused on news and information. However, in the 1980s, NPR began to expand its programming to include more cultural and entertainment programming. Today, NPR offers a wide variety of programming, including news, talk, music, and cultural programming.

Its flagship program, “Morning Edition,” is a daily news program that covers breaking news, politics, business, and culture from around the world. Other popular NPR programs include “All Things Considered,” “Fresh Air,” and “Wait Wait… Don’t Tell Me!”

NPR’s future is uncertain. The organization is facing a number of challenges, including declining listenership and funding. It remains to be seen if this public / private model has a place in the future media landscape.
