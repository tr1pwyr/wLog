Of all the questions aspiring computer science learners ask, there is one that comes up the most often ‚Äì what programming language should I learn?

![What Programming Language](/uploads/2023/02/WhatProgrammingLanguage.webp)

As a beginner programmer, choosing the right programming language to learn can be overwhelming. With so many languages available, it can be challenging to know which one to focus on. In this article, we‚Äôll compare some popular programming languages to help you decide which one to start with.

Should I learn Python or Java?

Python and Java are two of the most popular programming languages. Both languages are widely used in industry and have[ large communities of developers](https://stackoverflow.com). Here are some things to consider when choosing between Python and Java as your first language:

### Similarities and Differences

[Python](https://www.python.org/) and Java are similar in some ways. For example, both languages are object-oriented, meaning that they use objects to represent data and functionality. They also both have extensive libraries that make it easy to perform common tasks.

However, there are also some significant differences between the two languages. For example, Python is known for its simplicity and readability, while Java is known for its performance and scalability. Java also has a steeper learning curve than Python, which may make it more challenging for beginners.

### Pros and Cons

One advantage of learning Python is that it‚Äôs an easy language to pick up. Python‚Äôs syntax is straightforward and easy to read, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners. Python is also an excellent language for data analysis, scientific computing, and web development.

On the other hand, Java is a powerful language that‚Äôs widely used in industry. Java is used to develop a wide range of applications, from desktop software to mobile apps to large-scale [cloud computing](https://wlog.app/posts/cloud-computing-for-developers.html) systems. Java is also an excellent language for learning object-oriented programming.

### Examples

Here are some examples of what you can do with each language:

- Python: build web applications with Django or Flask, analyze data with NumPy and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and create machine learning models with TensorFlow or Scikit-learn.
- Java: build desktop applications with JavaFX, create Android apps with Android Studio, and develop enterprise applications with Spring Framework.

## Should I learn C++ or Python as my first language?

C++ and Python are two other popular programming languages. C++ is a low-level language that‚Äôs commonly used in system programming, while Python is a high-level language that‚Äôs widely used in web development, scientific computing, and machine learning.

### Similarities and Differences

C++ and Python are very different languages. C++ is a low-level language that gives the programmer more control over the computer‚Äôs hardware. This can make it more challenging to learn but also makes it a powerful language for system programming.

Python, on the other hand, is a high-level language that‚Äôs easy to learn and use. Python‚Äôs syntax is simple and intuitive, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners. Python is also an excellent language for scientific computing, web development, and machine learning.

### Pros and Cons

One advantage of learning C++ is that it teaches you how the computer works at a low level. This can be an invaluable skill for system programming or for optimizing performance in other areas. However, C++ has a steep learning curve, and it may take longer to become proficient in than Python.

Python, on the other hand, is an easy language to learn and use. Python‚Äôs syntax is straightforward, and it has an extensive library of modules and packages that make it easy to perform common tasks. Python is also an excellent language for scientific computing and machine learning.

### Examples

Here are some examples of what you can do with each language:

- C++: develop video games with [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US), build operating systems or device drivers, and create high-performance applications.
- Python: build web applications with Django or Flask, analyze data with NumPy and Pandas, and create machine learning models with TensorFlow or Scikit learn.

### What Programming Language?

As you can see, both comparisons use Python. Neither comparison uses JavaScript üôÇ  
  
My recommendation is that if you are starting to learn programming from scratch in [2023](https://wlog.app/posts/its-2032.html) learn Python. There are many beginner friendly resources, it is less ‚Äúsyntaxy‚Äù, and most people find it the simplest to get started with. While I do not suggest ending your programming education with Python, I don‚Äôt find that it is an almost ideal starting point.
