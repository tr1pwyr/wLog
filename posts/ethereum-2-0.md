Ethereum founder [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) has hit back at those who questioned Ethereum’s ability as a deflationary currency during the development of Ethereum 2.0.which has been optimized to support applications outside the monetary system.

The world is waiting for the planned update of the Ethereum blockchain, which will switch the chain from a proof-of-work consensus system (PoW) to a proof-of-stake mechanism (PoS).

**Ethereum is not just a blockchain, it is a distributed software platform that enables developers to develop and deploy decentralized applications.**

This has created an entire ecosystem of [Dapp and Defi](https://dappvolk.com/) decentralized technologies.

Ether, the parent currency of the Ethereum blockchain, can be sent instantly to anyone in the world and is also used as digital money. With Ethereum, users can also create non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which is a unique use case made possible by blockchain technology. NFTs are rare digital objects, which is why they are sometimes called [crypto](https://wlog.app/posts/crypto-volatility.html) – collectibles.

Gas transactions on Ethereum are not carried out with ETH, but with the virtual machine of Ethereum. The ETH is used to pay transaction fees, this makes up a large portion of the global Ethereum trading volume.

The ETH is divisible to 18 decimal places and is the original asset of the Ethereum Blockchain, which pays transaction fees for sending transactions and interacting with dApps.
