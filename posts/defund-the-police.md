I need to preface this article by saying that my point of view is that every adult should be able to do whatever they want to do as long as they are not hurting anyone else.

> I want LGBTQ people to be able to buy guns with crypto while smoking weed at their weddings.

You can substitute the groups and the freedoms to whatever it is that you are passionate about; the point is that I want to protect your freedoms as well as long as you are not harming others and allow them to be free.

That being the case I don’t think that I should be able to tell other people how they should live. If you follow that logic it is easy to come to the conclusion that people that do not want police in their communities should be able to decide that for themselves.

#### Representative Democracy

If we do indeed live in a representative democracy, and the people in any given city vote to defund the police to the point where they are unable to respond to calls, who am I to tell them that they are wrong? I’m guessing that the police themselves do not enjoy going into neighborhoods full of people that hate them. People that disagree are free to leave and move to areas whose collective values more closely match their own, no?

#### Give the People what they Want

This does not mean that I think that defunding the [police](https://headlin3s.com/tag/police) will make these cities better. It just means that I know that I should not be able ( nor want to ) project my opinions and beliefs on to others.

**I might, in the way of trying to be helpful, explain the law of unintended consequences.**

I would probably start by explaining that ambulances won’t go to crime scenes until the police clear it. Similarly truckers can’t deliver goods to areas that are not insured. Insurance companies do not insure areas that are not policed. So beyond crime running rampant defunding the police would affect healthcare and commerce as well in these cities.

Of course if we were to work things this way, it would have to work the same way in reverse. [Conservative and rural areas ](https://wlog.app/posts/florida-aint-portland.html)that do want a sheriff department and believe in the Second Amendment should be able to decide that for themselves as well.

#### The Federal Government 

Originally the states in the United States were set up as mini governmental laboratories. Good ideas would make states employing them better than states with bad ideas. We have gotten away from this idea and grown the federal government.

Now is the perfect time to reverse that trend. We should start listening to the people who actually live in the vast and varied communities across America. Defunding the police in the places that are trying to do so is a logical starting point.
