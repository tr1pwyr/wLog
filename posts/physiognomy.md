# Physiognomy and AI: The Future of Face Reading

Physiognomy is the practice of interpreting a person's character or personality from their facial features. It has been around for centuries, and is still practiced in many parts of the world today, including China.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using AI to improve the accuracy of physiognomy. In [China](https://headlin3s.com/dateline/China), a number of companies have developed AI-powered physiognomy apps that can analyze a person's face and generate a report on their personality, health, and even career prospects.

## Face++: The Future of Physiognomy?

One of the leading companies in this field is [Meitu](https://www.meitu.com/en/), a Chinese social media company that is also known for its photo editing apps. Meitu's physiognomy app, called Face++ (or Meipai in Chinese), has been downloaded over 1 billion times.

Face++ uses AI to analyze a person's face in over 200 dimensions, including the shape of their face, the size of their eyes, and the distance between their features. The app then uses this data to generate a report on the person's personality, health, and career prospects.

Face++ has been praised for its accuracy, and has been used by a number of Chinese companies to screen job applicants and select new employees. The app has also been used by law enforcement agencies to identify criminals.

However, Face++ has also been criticized for its potential to be used for discriminatory purposes. For example, some critics have argued that the app could be used to discriminate against people with certain facial features, such as those with large noses or small eyes.

### AI for physiognomy

Despite these criticisms, the use of AI for physiognomy is likely to continue to grow in China. As AI technology continues to improve, it is possible that physiognomy could become a more accurate and reliable way to assess a person's character and personality.

In addition to the use of AI, there is also a growing interest in using other technologies, such as virtual reality, to enhance the practice of physiognomy. For example, some companies are developing VR headsets that can be used to create a 3D model of a person's face. This model can then be used to analyze the person's facial features in more detail.

#### The future of physiognomy

The use of technology to enhance physiognomy is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to revolutionize the practice. As these technologies continue to develop, it is possible that physiognomy could become a more mainstream practice, and could even be used in a variety of professional settings, such as healthcare and law enforcement.
