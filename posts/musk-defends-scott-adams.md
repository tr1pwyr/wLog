On Thursday, entrepreneur and Tesla CEO Elon Musk Defended Scott Adams on Twitter. Musk lambasted the media for their “straight-up Racist” coverage of Scott Adams. Adams is the creator of the Dilbert comic strip. Many media outlets branded Adam’s a racist without digging into the details behind the comments.

> For a \*very\* long time, US media was racist against non-white people, now they’re racist against whites &amp; Asians. Same thing happened with elite colleges &amp; high schools in America. Maybe they can try not being racist.

Adams made some controversial remarks about personally separating from black people. His comments were in response a poll that found “nearly half of all Blacks are not OK with white people.”

## It’s okay to be White

Scott Adams went on the [Hotep Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeFA-n3SMRw) show to respond to the”It’s Okay to be white” poll rant. The conversation is deep, nuanced, and informative.

Adams and Musk have objected to the Anti-Defamation League has labeling “It’s ok to be white” as hate speech. They are not alone. A full 72% of Americans agreed with the statement, including a majority of Black respondents.

### Musk Stands up for Scott

Musk defends Scott Adams on Twitter, not happy with how the media was handled it :

> “The way the media is spinning Scott Adams’ comments is straight-up RACIST,” he wrote. “They are taking a smart, thoughtful guy’s words out of context and portraying him as a bigot.”

Adams has objected to being characterized conservative and “MAGA” and identifies as a left wing.

Musk went on to say that the media has “an obligation to report accurately. “The media’s lazy, clickbait approach to journalism is dangerous” he added. He concluded by saying that the media should be “ashamed” of themselves.

Musk said that the media is “constantly attacking” people like Adams and himself while refusing to acknowledge their accomplishments. He also accused the media of having a “double standard” when it comes to race.

#### Musk Vs. Media

This is not the first time [Musk](https://wlog.app/posts/elon-musk-tries-to-buy-twitter.html) has taken on the media. The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, has had a tumultuous relationship with the media. He has been rumored to lash out at journalists and news outlets who he perceives as being critical of his companies or personal life

Tesla CEO Elon Musk as called out “fossil fuel propaganda”. In July, he called out [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/) for their “fossil fuel propaganda” after they ran a critical story about Tesla. And in September, he accused The New York Times of being “in cahoots” with short-sellers after they published a negative review of the Tesla Model 3.

In 2018, Musk famously went on a Twitter tirade against the [me](https://headlin3s.com/categories/Media)[d](https://headlin3s.com/cat/media)[ia](https://headlin3s.com/categories/Media). He called them “hypocrites” and suggesting that he would create a platform to rate the credibility of journalists and news organizations.

Despite his fraught relationship with the media, Musk has also used the media to his advantage. He often uses Twitter to make announcements or drum up publicity for his companies. His unfiltered approach to social media has helped him build a loyal following of fans. They appreciate his candidness and willingness to engage with the public.
