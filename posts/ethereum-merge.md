The Ethereum merge is now complete, how does it affect the market?

Ever since the Ethereum inception, many developers started exploring ways to implement Proof of Stake as the main way to verify transaction. While Ethereum has been around since 2015, the transition to the Proof of Stake method was finalized in September 2022. This process is a technical upgrade, called the Merge, and it does bring in quite a lot of interesting benefits to the market.

#### What are the benefits of the Ethereum Merge?

The major benefit behind the Ethereum merge is that the energy consumption is reduced up to 99.95%. That means Ethereum generates way less carbon than ever before. Additionally companies can adopt the Ethereum network without having to worry about sustainability regulations and electricity use.
  
On top of that, Ethereum is set to generate a yield of 4% to 6% of the annual basis, if the holder is staking their Ethereum to the network. Staking will help the network grow and boost its security, while also pushing new players to enter the network. Ethereum is also paving the way for sharding with this method, which divides the Ethereum blockchain into smaller blockchains. Validators are more efficient because they only have to monitor a specific shard, which makes validation faster and very dependable.

#### What do investors think about the Ethereum merge?

Many investors are excited about the merge because it helps cut the energy usage, while also eliminating the centralized control. Control was in the hands of those that had powerful [crypto](https://headlin3s.com/cat/crypto) mining rigs. The proof of stake approach is more efficient and it also makes the platform less prone to attacks.

One thing to note is that the overall fees are not expected to change, they will remain the same for the foreseeable future. There will be a slight change when it comes to transaction speeds. Historically, Ethereum blocks are issued every 13-14 seconds, with the proof of stake system they will be issued every 12 seconds. It’s not a major increase, but it’s certainly a difference when compared to the previous system.

#### Is the Merge going to affect Ethereum price going forward?

Unfortunately it’s very hard to predict what will happen to Ethereum after the merge.   
  
Decreasing the Ethereum issuing rate was designed a boon for the price. As of now the market is not impressed. There are specialists stating POS will end up being less secure than POW, which could send the price spiraling downwards. As you can see, [experts are all over the place](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-09-19/ethereum-s-merge-was-a-success-crypto-still-has-problems), and with so many variables, it can be hard to know where the Ethereum price will go in the months and years to come.

#### Can you become an Ethereum staker?

[You can start staking Ethereum right now](https://wallet.uphold.com/signup?referral=a6ac5c8d4f), if you have some ether. However, if you want to become a validator, you will need 32 ETH to activate your own validator. If you don’t want to become a validator, staking is possible and also recommended since it can bring in some benefits.  
  
Is the Ethereum merge a step forward? While there are some people skeptical about the move, it’s important to note that proof of stake transition ideas were in their inception as soon as the Ethereum platform was launched.

This merge is a culmination of many years of work behind the scenes. Overall, its focus on sustainability and security are welcome additions. They are bound to help improve the platform going forward.
