Here are 5 apps you might not know about that are better than Facebook at helping you stay up-to-date.

#### The Best Alternatives to Facebook

1.) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home)

Twitter is a social media site that is similar to Facebook in many ways. However, it has a much shorter character limit per post, which encourages users to be concise and to the point. This can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your preferences.

Twitter also has a more real-time feel to it than Facebook, as generally [tweets are displayed in reverse chronological order](https://tweetotheday.com/). This means that you are more likely to see timely updates from people you follow on Twitter better than on Facebook.

There’s a reason [Elon Musk was trying to buy Twitter](https://wlog.app/posts/elon-musk-tries-to-buy-twitter.html) and not Facebook.

2.) [Minds](https://www.minds.com/)

Minds is an open-source social network that values privacy and freedom of expression. Unlike Facebook, Minds doesn’t censor its users or their content. It’s also ad-free and doesn’t sell user data. You can sign up for Minds for free and start earning tokens.

3.) [MeWe](https://mewe.com/)

MeWe is a great alternative to Facebook because it doesn’t sell your data or show you ads. It’s also very easy to use. Simply create an account and start posting updates, photos, and videos like you would on Facebook. You can also join groups and join conversations with other users. The ease of use alone makes it better than Facebook imho.

4.) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)

Reddit is a social news aggregator and discussion forum that is organized into many different topic-specific communities (called “subreddits”). If you’re interested in staying up-to-date on current events, news, or anything else, chances are there’s a subreddit for it. Reddit also has an upvoting and downvoting system for posts, so the most popular and relevant content rises to the top while the less popular stuff sinks to the bottom.

### Other Apps Better than Facebook

5.) [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/en-US)

Snapchat is a messaging app that is known for its unique features, such as self-destructing messages and filters/lenses that can be used to modify photos and videos. But Snapchat also has a “Stories” feature that allows users to post photos and videos that can be viewed by their friends for 24 hours. This makes Snapchat a great way to stay up-to-date on what your friends are doing, even if they’re not actively messaging you.

6.) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/)

Instagram is a photo and video sharing app that is owned by Facebook. However, it has a more visual focus than Facebook and is very popular with younger users. Instagram also has a Stories feature that is similar to Snapchat’s, but with some additional features such as location tagging and the ability to post longer videos. It feels like Facebook’s hipper younger cousin.

#### Is Whats App Social Media? Is it Better than Facebook?

7.) [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/)

WhatsApp is a messaging app that like Instagram is owned by Facebook. It is similar to other messaging apps like Snapchat and Instagram, but it also has some unique features such as end-to-end encryption for all messages and calls, meaning that only the sender and receiver can see or hear the content of the message/call.   
  
WhatsApp also allows users to send each other files of any type (up to 100 MB), making it a great way to share photos, videos, or even documents with your friends.

8.) [Pinterest ](https://www.pinterest.com/)

With its visually appealing platform, Pinterest is perfect for finding new recipes, fashion inspiration, or home décor ideas. It is also a great way to connect with other people who share your interests. Don’t sleep on Pinterest just because it is not a traditional [social media](https://headlin3s.com/cat/social%20media), many find it’s simplicity much better than Facebook’s complexity.

9.) [Vero](https://vero.co/)

Vero is another great alternative to Facebook. Like MeWe, it doesn’t sell your data or show you ads. However, it goes a step further by allowing you to control who sees your posts. You can choose to share your posts with all your followers, only certain people, or only yourself. This makes Vero perfect for sharing sensitive information or for people who want more control over their privacy.
