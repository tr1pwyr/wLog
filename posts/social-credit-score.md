### What Is a Social Credit Score?

A social credit score is a way for businesses and other organizations to measure an individual’s trustworthiness. It’s similar to a financial credit score, but instead of measuring your ability to repay loans, it measures your overall trustworthiness.

Organizations use social credit scores to decide whether or not to do business with you, or whether to give you a loan. A high social credit score means you’re considered trustworthy and reliable, while a low score means you’re seen as untrustworthy and unreliable.

#### What is your social credit score?

There are a few different ways your social credit score can be calculated. The most common method is by looking at your credit score, arrest records, and online activity. [Social media](https://headlin3s.com/cat/social%20media) platforms like Facebook and Twitter keep track of everything you do. This information can be used to calculate your social credit score.

Some people believe that social credit scores are an invasion of privacy and fundamentally unfair. For example, many information brokers trade data that isn’t accurate or complete. This information could be used against you even if you’re otherwise trustworthy and reliable. It is also worth considering who gets to decide if you *made a mistake* on social media?

Others believe that social credit scores are a necessary evil. The argue that they help businesses make better decisions about who to do business with.

##### Why Should You Care about social credit scores?

Your social credit score is a measure of your trustworthiness and reliability. More companies are implementing ESG policies every day. Policies that determine if you get approved for loans, credit cards, or even a rental lease. A bad ESG score can make it harder to get access to the financial products you need.

A social credit score is based on information from your public records. These could include your credit history, criminal record, rental history, employment status. Any data that reviewers can use to assess your risk. The scoring system is designed to give others an idea of how likely you are to repay debts, be a good employee, tenant, etc.

A high score means you’re considered a low-risk. This could lead to lower interest rates, better loan terms, easier mortgage approval. It could even determine whether you get a job or not. A low score could make it harder to get approved for loans or lines of credit. If you do get approved you may be offered less favorable terms.

#### China’s Approach to Social Credit Scores

Social credit scores are a controversial topic in [China.](https://headlin3s.com/dateline/China) The Chinese government is using social credit scores to track the financial and social behavior of its citizens. This has led to a lot of debate about the merits and drawbacks of this approach.

They can be a way for the government to track the financial behavior of citizens and identify potential risks. On the other hand, there are clear risks of [governments unfairly punishing people](https://wlog.app/posts/biden-administration-incompetent-or-vindictive.html) for their personal choices.

The Chinese government is still working out the details of its social credit score system. It’s possible that there will be changes in the future, depending on how well the system works. In more open societies there is more likely to be public opposition there is to it in China.

For now though scores are a reality in China and they’re likely to have a big impact on people’s lives.

#### How the United States Could Implement a Social Credit System

The idea of a social credit score is not new. The concept was first proposed by economist Thomas Paine in 1795 as a way to fund public works projects. In the early 1900s, the Canadian government [implemented a social credit system](https://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/sustainable-agriculture/2739771.pdf). The idea was to encourage farmers to buy more efficient farm equipment.

Recently there has been growing interest in the idea of using a social credit score to assess an individual’s trustworthiness. In China, the government has been experimenting with a social credit system. The Chinese system gives citizens a score based on their behavior.

There is no reason why the United States couldn’t implement a similar system. There are already many data sources that could be used to calculate a person’s social credit score. Credit reports, criminal records, and social media activity are just the start. The government could use this information to create a score that would reflect an individual’s trustworthiness.

#### Social Credit Scores in the Future

Some experts believe that one may be necessary in the future. They argue that the U.S. has become increasingly polarized and that trustworthiness is essential for maintaining a functioning society.

Critics say that it would be used to unfairly discriminate against certain groups of people. They also worry that it would give the government too much control over citizens’ lives and erode any remaining privacy.

It remains to be seen whether or not a social credit system will be implemented in the United States. However, it is clear that the idea is gaining traction and it is something that Americans should be aware of.

A social credit score is a numerical representation of your trustworthiness as a member of society. While this may sound Orwellian, there are some potential benefits. Whether or not you think social credit scores are a good idea, it’s important to be aware of them and how they could impact your life in the future.
