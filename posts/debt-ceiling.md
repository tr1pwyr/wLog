The United States debt ceiling is a limit on the amount of money the federal government can borrow. It was put in place in 1917 and has been raised 78 times since then. The current ceiling is $22 trillion.

The debt ceiling is important because it prevents the government from defaulting on its debt. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the government will not be able to borrow any more money and will default on its debt.   
  
**This could be catastrophic for the economy.**

There are a few potential solutions to the potential crisis. One solution is to raise the debt ceiling. Another solution is to cut spending. And a third solution is to create a budget surplus.

United States Congress will vote on the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is also important because it forces the government to make tough choices about spending. If the government knows it can only borrow a certain amount of money, it will be more careful about how it spends that money.

#### History of the debt ceiling in the United States

First put in place in 1917 as the federal government was borrowing a lot of money to finance its involvement in World War I. [Congress](https://headlin3s.com/tag/congress) wanted to limit the amount of money the government could borrow, so it passed a new law. Since 1917, the ceiling has been raised 78 times. It was raised most recently in February of 2018. This has been a contentious issue in recent years, as some members of Congress have tried to use it to force spending cuts.

#### How does it affect the economy?

 First, if the ceiling is not raised, the government will default on its debt. This would be catastrophic for the economy, as it would lead to higher interest rates and massive spending cuts. Secondly it affects the economy by forcing the government to make tough choices about spending. If the government knows it can only borrow a certain amount of money, it will be more careful about how it spends that money.  
  
 If the ceiling is not raised, [the government](https://wlog.app/posts/government-danger.html) will default on its debt. This would be catastrophic for the economy, as it would lead to higher interest rates and massive spending cuts. It is essential that Congress pays close attention to our countryâ€™s debt-to-GDP ratio in order to ensure we are living within our means, avoiding yearly deficits and having sufficient resources for all Americans  
  
Congress has been trying to raise it for months, but has been unable to reach an agreement. If it is not raised soon, the government will default on its debt.
