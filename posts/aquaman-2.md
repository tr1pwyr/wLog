The DC cinematic universe has seen its share of highs and lows over the years, but Aquaman 2 The Lost Kingdom might just take the cake as the worst movie yet. The highly anticipated sequel to the 2018 film “Aquaman” is already being met with mixed (at best ) reviews.

Some are calling it the worst DC movie ever while others are simply walking out of the screenings. So what’s the verdict? Is “Aquaman 2” [really as bad as some are saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX1J7STUol0), or is it a worthy sequel to the first film?

The Bad:

- The pacing is uneven and there are several slow sections
- Some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy
- The CGI is often over-the-top and not always convincing
- The film feels like it’s trying too hard to be an epic blockbuster, when in reality it’s just another superhero sequel
- 20 minutes of Amber Heard?

### Worst DC movie Yet?

If you thought Suicide Squad was bad, wait until you this travesty. This movie is a complete mess, and it’s hard to find anything good to say about it. The plot is all over the place, the acting is terrible, and the CGI is some of the worst we’ve ever seen.

#### $205 Million Flop?

Aquaman 2 cost $205 million to make, and it is an unwatchable disaster. The movie is so poorly made that it is hard to believe that it cost so much money to make. Even harder to believe is that it will recoup these costs.

The good news, if there is any, is that most of the criticism is not aimed directly at Jason Momoa. For a movie that he stars in to be so overwhelmingly disliked most of the rumors involving him center on what he’ll do next to distance himself from this franchise.

##### Amber Heard

She single-handedly ruined “The Rum Diary” ( not to mention her co-star) and she’s even worse in “Aquaman”. Her character is completely one-dimensional and her acting is wooden. She’s pretty, but that’s about it. Some [people won’t go see this movie simply because Amber Heard is in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX1J7STUol0).

It very well may be that many people are just over the comic book movie as movie formula as it continue the streak of less than epic Marvel and DC movies. There is definitely a been there, seen that quality to Aquaman 2.
