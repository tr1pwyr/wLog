### The French Jacobin Revolution

The Jacobin Revolution, also known as the Reign of Terror, was a period of extreme political and social upheaval in France that took place from 1793 to 1794. The Jacobins were a radical political group they came to power during the second stage of the French Revolution.   
  
The Jacobin’s instituted a series of reforms that were designed to create a more egalitarian society. However, their methods were often violent and repressive, and the Revolution ultimately ended in the death of thousands of people.

The Jacobin Club was founded in 1789, shortly after the first stage of the French Revolution began. The republic was facing a number of challenges, including foreign invasion and internal rebellion. In an effort to address these challenges, the National Convention, the legislative body of the republic, gave more power to the Committee of Public Safety. This was a group of twelve men who were responsible for overseeing the war effort and maintaining order.

The Committee of Public Safety was led by Maximilien Robespierre, a radical Jacobin. Robespierre and his allies believed that the only way to save the republic was to establish a dictatorship and to use violence to suppress dissent. They instituted a series of reforms that were designed to create a more egalitarian society. These included the abolition of the monarchy, the nobility, and the church. They also instituted a system of [price controls and rationing](https://wlog.app/posts/seigniorage.html), and they nationalized key industries.

#### The Jacobin Revolution was a time of great violence. 

The Jacobins instituted a system of terror, after the execution of King Louis XVI. They used mass executions, known as the guillotine, to silence their opponents. Between 1793 and 1794, an estimated 40,000 people were executed by the Jacobins.

The Reign of Terror also led to the rise of new political factions. The Thermidorian Reaction, a group of moderate politicians who opposed the radical policies of the Jacobins. In July 1794, Robespierre and his followers were arrested and executed. This marked the end of the Reign of Terror and the beginning of a new phase in the Revolution.

The Jacobin Revolution was a period of intense political upheaval in France that had a profound impact on the course of [French](https://headlin3s.com/dateline/France) history. While its methods were brutal and its legacy is still debated today, its ideals of democracy, liberty, and equality continue to inspire people around the world.
