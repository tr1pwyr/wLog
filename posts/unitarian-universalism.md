Unitarian Universalism (UU) is a religious movement whose roots go back over 200 years.

In 1961, the universalist churches of the United States merged into a single body, the Unitarians and Universalist Association, or UUA for short.

 As they grew ever closer together theologically and ethically, they consolidated into the new religion of universalism. With roots in the United States and Canada, it follows the principles of the U.S. Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It provides for the protection of human rights, religious freedom and equal protection under the law.

## Unitarians and Universalists 

Today, Unitarian Universalism is a faith without creed. This enables individual Unitarians and universalists to seek the truth in many ways.

Spirituality is simply the process of discovering the truth about the nature of the universe, its nature and its meaning. It goes beyond what the human eye can perceive and beyond the limits of human knowledge and experience. Spirituality includes religion. Looking beyond the immediate concerns of humanity. Acting beyond ego and participating in the painful, glorious process of creation.

Religion refers to a certain creed of the existence of God. In the case of Christianity, to the details of faith, God and existence. Christians with a background in charismatic movements such as Pentecostalism have developed a version of universalism that could be called charismatic [Christian](https://headlin3s.com/tag/christian) universalism. There seems to be a hybrid between charismatic and liberal Christianity. There is a kind of Christian universalism that deviates from it. Evangelical Christianity (also called biblical Trinitarian universalism) is another sect.

The word “universalist” was first used in 1626 to describe those who believe in universal salvation, that all will go to heaven. In theological use, universalism is the belief that we will come to the final salvation and spend eternity in heaven with God. Adherence to this teaching also implies there are many ways to reach Heaven. Baptism, ordination to the priesthood, or even death and resurrection.

### Unitarian Universalism places value on the interconnectedness of all things.

At our best we recognize the wisdom of all religions. Whether Jewish, Hindu or whatever in between, we are universalists of unity and explore all these traditions without pretending to be like you. What holds us together is our commitment to work together on our journey of honor. Universalist Universalism: We have the same values and values as any other [religious group](https://wlog.app/posts/alternative-community.html) in the US, but we have a different set of beliefs and practices.

#### Wisdom and Value

We do not profess a single irrefutable truth. Universalism is not the right religious path for all. We believe that in most religions there is wisdom and value, and that no religion has all the answers. Our members tend to maintain an open mind in our continued search for our own religious and spiritual truths. No statement or conviction binds us. We believe in the wisdom of all religions, whether they are wisdom, values or most religions.

As a result, many universalists may believe different things, and while the Congregation holds common principles. Individual universalists may discern their own convictions on spiritual, ethical, or theological issues. We believe in the search and formation of our own faith in the wisdom of all religions, and in the formation and search for our own convictions. Very few of them understand God as a “person of being” who interferes in human affairs.

We must break and modify it so that our individual and group experiences would by definition be less universal. The essential divinity, and thus the unity of all creatures, as a result of the universal nature of human experience and our relationship with it.

##### Respect and Compassion

We promise to treat each other with respect and compassion. We must have an equally loving relationship with the soil of all beings. In contemporary terms, we choose to live in the right relationship. Offering a free pulpit and free pews; our church leaders are free to tell the truth as long as they know it without expressions of mistrust, while the recipients of the preacher’s message are also free to either accept or reject it.

To practice and proclaim the universalism of the 21st century, one does not have to believe in an old universalist God. Let alone use the Word of God. The unified and universalist tradition is also based on alliances, but in a different way from many other forms of universalism.
