You wake up groggy, disoriented. It’s been a while since you’ve slept through the night. You rub your eyes and try to make sense of your surroundings.

Everything looks different. You don’t recognize the furniture, the pictures on the wall, the clothes in your closet. Even your own reflection is unfamiliar. Everything feels surreal and dream-like. You can’t tell what’s real and what’s not. Nothing seems to make sense.

 It takes a few minutes for you to realize that it’s 2032 and nothing looks the same to you because you’ve just woken up from a 10-year cryo-coma.

#### The world has changed in 10 years

The world has changed a lot in the last 10 years. Technology has advanced, new countries have been formed, new political systems imagined; the very way we live has changed dramatically. It can be difficult to keep up with all the changes, but it’s important to try.

After all, the its an ever-changing world in which we live in and it’s important to stay informed about what’s going on in it.

It can be overwhelming at first, but try to remember that you’re not alone. There are people who have gone through the same thing as you and they can help you adjust to this new world. Find others that can’t believe that it’s 2032.

### What’s New In 2032

With the rise of Neurolink [social media](https://wlog.app/posts/tag/twitter.html), we are now able to connect with people all over the world instantly. This has made it easier than ever to stay in touch with friends and family, but it has also led to a lot of information overload. We are constantly bombarded with news and updates, which can be overwhelming at times.

You’ll have to decide for yourself if you want the chip implant. Before you decide against it remember that it’s the only way to participate in modern society. For example you cannot vote or enter government building without a valid neurolink implant.

One of the most noticeable changes is that the population has exploded and resources are scarce. More subtle is that the average person is shorter, thanks to a lack of proper nutrition, and life expectancy is lower. There are also more environmental disasters and the weather is more extreme. The sea levels have risen, making coastal areas in [Florida](https://headlin3s.com/dateline/Florida) uninhabitable, and society has become more violent.

Remember, your peers are immersed in a completely digital world where everything is about blockchain and virtual reality. Digital identity is more important than ever. Open borders are now open to trade, information and people.

#### Cash, Tech, and Sec in 2032

Cash has become obsolete; we have moved to a completely digital economy based on [cryptocurrency](https://wallet.uphold.com/signup?referral=a6ac5c8d4f). Instead of gas powered cars, people are using a variety of new methods to get around include flying cars, hovercrafts, scooters, and even personal jetpacks – finally!

In addition to the ubiquitous Neurolink there are many new exciting communication technologies on the horizon including telepathy, holograms, and of course virtual reality.

Security is even more important now than it ever has been. With the advances in [technology](https://headlin3s.com/cat/tech) there are constantly new ways for criminals to commit crimes. You will need to learn the newest ways to protect yourself from these crimes. Most of these include biometric data: fingerprints, iris scans, and facial recognition.

Despite all these changes, the human spirit remains the same. We are still capable of love and hope, and we continue to strive for a better future. You’re going to have to adapt, there’s no two ways about it. It won’t be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is.
