## Gun Violence Marred Juneteenth Celebrations

Juneteenth is a holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. It is a time for reflection, celebration, and community. However, this year, Juneteenth was also marred by gun violence

### A Disturbing Trend

In recent years, Juneteenth has witnessed a rise in gun violence incidents, causing immeasurable pain and anguish to communities across the nation. The senseless loss of lives and the trauma inflicted on individuals and families demand our immediate attention and concerted efforts to address the underlying causes.

In the early hours of Juneteenth, a shooting in Chicago left 10 people dead and 38 injured. The shooting took place in a popular nightlife district, and many of the victims were young people.

Later that day, a shooting in Milwaukee left 2 people dead and 7 injured. The shooting took place at a block party, and many of the victims were children.

Gun violence incidents on Juneteenth exacerbate the trauma experienced by communities already grappling with historic levels of crime. These events further deepen feelings of insecurity and perpetuate a cycle of violence. The emotional scars borne by survivors and witnesses can have long-lasting effects on mental health, community cohesion, and overall well-being.

#### Never Waste A Tragedy

These shootings have renewed calls for action on gun violence. President Biden has called for stricter gun control measures, and many lawmakers are now considering new legislation.

However, it is unclear how adding regulations to legal gun ownership would affect illegal gun ownership . The issue of gun control is highly divisive, and it is likely to be a major issue in the upcoming midterm elections.

According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been over 24,000 gun-related deaths in the United States so far in 2023. This includes over 14,000 suicides and over 9,000 homicides.

The occurrence of gun violence, shootings, and killings on Juneteenth stands as a painful reminder of the violence that plagues our society. The United States has a violence problem that is unmatched by any other developed country. In 2020, the United States had a homicide rate of 4.12 per 100,000 people.

##### Mental Health and Big Pharma
Addressing the root causes of gun violence one must examine the explosion of chemicals from big pharma being ingested by Americans. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the percentage of Americans who took an SSRI in the past month increased from 2.7% in 1999 to 12.7% in 2014. 

This represents a 400% increase in the use of SSRIs over just a 15-year period.  The percentages have only increased from there. Combined with the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill the streets of America have never been less mentally healthy.

###### Criminal Reform

Early release and cashless bail have combined to ensure that there are more violent criminals on the street.  When you increase the percentage of violent criminals on the street, the number of violent crimes will increase.  It is unclear wheter or not these criminal reforms will begin to pay off in the future.

**In the meantime, gun violence continues. On Juneteenth, we should have been celebrating the end of slavery. Instead, we were mourning the victims of gun violence.**
